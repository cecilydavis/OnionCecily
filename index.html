    <p>LANGLEY, VA-A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has
mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.</p>

    <p>According to the report, sections of the documents- "almost invariably the most crucial passages"-are marred
by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.</p>

    <ul>CIA Director Porter Goss lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as:

    <li>The Cold War</li>
    <li>The civil-rights movement</li>
    <li>The growth of the international drug trade</li>
    </ul>
